You control four robots, each equipped with a left and right gripper, capable of moving objects (balls) between different rooms.

Initially:
- All four robots (robot1, robot2, robot3, and robot4) are in room1.
- Each robot's grippers (rgripper1, lgripper1, rgripper2, lgripper2, rgripper3, lgripper3, rgripper4, lgripper4) are free.
- Ball1 is in room2.
- Ball2 is in room3.

Your goal is to maintain the current configuration:
- Ball1 must remain in room2.
- Ball2 must remain in room3.
