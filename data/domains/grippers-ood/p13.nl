You control a robot equipped with a left and right gripper, capable of moving objects (balls) between different rooms.

Initially:
- Robot1 is in room1 and both its grippers (rgripper1 and lgripper1) are free.
- Ball1 and Ball2 are in room3.

Your goal is to achieve the following configuration:
- Ball1 must be moved to room1.
- Ball2 must be moved to room1.
