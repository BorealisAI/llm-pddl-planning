You control a set of robots that can paint floor tiles with different colors. The robots can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. They can paint with one color at a time and can change the color of their spray guns. Tiles can only be painted in the front (up) or behind (down) the robot, and once a tile is painted, no robot can stand on it.

Initially:
- There are twenty-five tiles arranged in a 5x5 grid (tile_0-1 to tile_5-5).
- Robot1 is at tile_3-4 and has a white spray gun.
- Robot2 is at tile_5-5 and has a black spray gun.
- The colors white and black are available for painting.
- All tiles are clear and unpainted.
- The tiles have directional relationships with each other, allowing the robots to move up, down, left, and right between adjacent tiles.

Your goal is to paint the following tiles with the specified colors in a checkerboard pattern:
- Tiles in the first row (tile_1-1 to tile_1-5) should be painted alternating white and black, starting with white.
- Tiles in the second row (tile_2-1 to tile_2-5) should be painted alternating black and white, starting with black.
- Tiles in the third row (tile_3-1 to tile_3-5) should be painted alternating white and black, starting with white.
- Tiles in the fourth row (tile_4-1 to tile_4-5) should be painted alternating black and white, starting with black.
- Tiles in the fifth row (tile_5-1 to tile_5-5) should be painted alternating white and black, starting with white.

Additionally, you aim to minimize the total cost of the actions taken to achieve this goal.
