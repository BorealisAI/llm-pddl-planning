You control three robots, each with a left and right gripper, capable of moving objects (balls) between two rooms.

Initially:
- Robot1 is in room2, and both its grippers (rgripper1 and lgripper1) are free.
- Robot2 is in room1, and both its grippers (rgripper2 and lgripper2) are free.
- Robot3 is in room2, and both its grippers (rgripper3 and lgripper3) are free.
- Ball1 and Ball2 are in room2.
- Ball3 and Ball5 are in room1.
- Ball4 is also in room2.

Your goal is to achieve the following configuration:
- Ball1, Ball2, and Ball4 must be moved to room1.
- Ball3 must be moved to room2.
- Ball5 must remain in room1.
