You control a robot equipped with a left and right gripper, capable of moving objects (balls) between two different rooms.

Initially:
- Robot1 is in room1 and both its grippers (rgripper1 and lgripper1) are free.
- Ball1, Ball2, and Ball3 are all in room1.

Your goal is to achieve the following configuration:
- Ball1 must remain in room1.
- Ball2 must remain in room1.
- Ball3 must be moved to room2.
