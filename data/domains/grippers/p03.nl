You control two robots, each equipped with a left and right gripper, capable of moving objects (balls) between different rooms.

Initially:
- Robot1 is in room1 and both its grippers (rgripper1 and lgripper1) are free.
- Robot2 is in room2 and both its grippers (rgripper2 and lgripper2) are free.
- Ball1 and Ball2 are both in room1.

Your goal is to achieve the following configuration:
- Ball1 must be moved to room5.
- Ball2 must be moved to room4.
