You control two robots, each equipped with a left and right gripper, capable of moving objects (balls) between two rooms.

Initially:
- Robot1 is in room2 and both its grippers (rgripper1 and lgripper1) are free.
- Robot2 is in room1 and both its grippers (rgripper2 and lgripper2) are free.
- Ball1, Ball2, Ball3, Ball4, and Ball5 are all in room1.

Your goal is to achieve the following configuration:
- Ball1 must remain in room1.
- Ball2 must remain in room1.
- Ball3 must be moved to room2.
- Ball4 must remain in room1.
- Ball5 must remain in room1.
