You control three robots, each with a left and right gripper, capable of moving objects (balls) between different rooms.

Initially:
- Robot1 is in room4 and both its grippers (rgripper1 and lgripper1) are free.
- Robot2 is in room1 and both its grippers (rgripper2 and lgripper2) are free.
- Robot3 is in room3 and both its grippers (rgripper3 and lgripper3) are free.
- Ball1 is in room4.
- Ball2 and Ball3 are in room3.
- Ball4 and Ball5 are in room2.
- Ball6 is in room1.
- Ball7 is also in room3.

Your goal is to achieve the following configuration:
- Ball1 must be moved to room1.
- Ball2 must be moved to room4.
- Ball3 must remain in room3.
- Ball4 must be moved to room4.
- Ball5 must be moved to room3.
- Ball6 must be moved to room2.
- Ball7 must be moved to room1.
