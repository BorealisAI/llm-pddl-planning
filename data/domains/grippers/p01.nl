You control two robots, each equipped with a left and right gripper, capable of moving objects (balls) between two rooms.

Initially:
- Both Robot1 and Robot2 are in room1.
- Both grippers of Robot1 (rgripper1 and lgripper1) are free.
- Both grippers of Robot2 (rgripper2 and lgripper2) are free.
- Both Ball1 and Ball2 are in room1.

Your goal is to maintain the current configuration:
- Ball1 must remain in room1.
- Ball2 must remain in room1.
