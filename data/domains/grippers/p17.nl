You control four robots, each equipped with a left and right gripper, capable of moving objects (balls) between two rooms.

Initially:
- Robot1 is in room1 and both its grippers (rgripper1 and lgripper1) are free.
- Robot2 and Robot3 are in room2, and all their grippers (rgripper2, lgripper2, rgripper3, and lgripper3) are free.
- Robot4 is in room1 and both its grippers (rgripper4 and lgripper4) are free.
- Ball1 and Ball5 are in room1.
- Ball2, Ball3, and Ball4 are in room2.

Your goal is to achieve the following configuration:
- Ball1 must be moved to room2.
- Ball2 must remain in room2.
- Ball3 must be moved to room1.
- Ball4 must be moved to room1.
- Ball5 must remain in room1.
