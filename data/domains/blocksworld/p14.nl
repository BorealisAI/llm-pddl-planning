You are tasked with manipulating a set of blocks using a robotic arm that can perform four actions: pickup, putdown, stack, and unstack.

Initially:
- The robotic arm is empty.
- Block b1 is on block b3.
- Block b2 is on the table.
- Block b3 is also on the table.
- Block b4 is on block b6, and it is clear.
- Block b5 is on block b1, and it is clear.
- Block b6 is on the table.
- Block b7 is on block b2.
- Block b8 is on block b9, and it is clear.
- Block b9 is on block b7.

Your goal is to achieve the following configuration:
- Block b1 must be on block b2.
- Block b2 must be on block b7.
- Block b3 must be on block b5.
- Block b4 must be on block b1.
- Block b5 must be on block b6.
- Block b7 must be on block b8.
- Block b8 must be on block b3.
- Block b9 must be on block b4.
