You are tasked with manipulating a set of blocks using a robotic arm that can perform four actions: pickup, putdown, stack, and unstack.

Initially:
- The robotic arm is empty.
- Block b1 is on the table.
- Block b2 is on block b1.
- Block b3 is on block b4.
- Block b4 is on block b2.
- Block b5 is on block b3, and it is clear.

Your goal is to achieve the following configuration:
- Block b1 must be stacked on top of block b2.
- Block b3 must be stacked on top of block b5.
- Block b4 must be stacked on top of block b1.
