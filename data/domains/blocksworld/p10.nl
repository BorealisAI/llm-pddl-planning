You are tasked with manipulating a set of blocks using a robotic arm that can perform four actions: pickup, putdown, stack, and unstack.

Initially:
- The robotic arm is empty.
- Block b1 is on the table, with block b7 on top of it.
- Block b2 is clear and on top of block b5.
- Block b3 is on the table, with block b6 on top of it.
- Block b4 is clear and on top of block b7.
- Block b5 is on the table.
- Block b6 is clear.
- Block b7 is on top of block b1.

Your goal is to achieve the following configuration:
- Block b1 must be on top of block b7.
- Block b2 must be on top of block b5.
- Block b3 must be on top of block b2.
- Block b4 must be on top of block b1.
- Block b5 must be on top of block b6.
- Block b7 must be on top of block b3.
