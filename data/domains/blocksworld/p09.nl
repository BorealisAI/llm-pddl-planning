You are tasked with manipulating a set of blocks using a robotic arm that can perform four actions: pickup, putdown, stack, and unstack.

Initially:
- The robotic arm is empty.
- Blocks b1 and b2 are on the table and are clear.
- Block b3 is on block b6.
- Block b4 is on block b7, and it is clear.
- Block b5 is on the table and is clear.
- Block b6 is on the table.
- Block b7 is on block b3.

Your goal is to achieve the following configuration:
- Block b1 must be stacked on top of block b2.
- Block b2 must be stacked on top of block b6.
- Block b3 must be stacked on top of block b7.
- Block b5 must be stacked on top of block b3.
- Block b6 must be stacked on top of block b5.
- Block b7 must be stacked on top of block b4.
