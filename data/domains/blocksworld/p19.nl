You are tasked with manipulating a set of blocks using a robotic arm that can perform four actions: pickup, putdown, stack, and unstack.

Initially:
- The robotic arm is empty.
- Block b1 is on the table with block b6 on top of it, and b6 is clear.
- Block b2 is on block b5, and b2 is clear.
- Block b3 is on block b8, and b3 is clear.
- Block b4 is on block b12, and b4 is clear.
- Block b5 is on block b7.
- Block b7 is on block b10.
- Block b8 is on the table.
- Block b9 is on the table with block b12 on top of it.
- Block b10 is on block b11.
- Block b11 is on the table.
- Block b12 is on block b9.

Your goal is to achieve the following configuration:
- Block b5 must be on block b10.
- Block b6 must be on block b12.
- Block b7 must be on block b4.
- Block b8 must be on block b3.
- Block b9 must be on block b2.
- Block b10 must be on block b8.
- Block b11 must be on block b7.
- Block b12 must be on block b11.
