The Termes domain is a planning domain that simulates the behavior of robotic agents (inspired by termites) that can move around, pick up blocks, stack them to build structures, and remove blocks from structures. The domain includes actions for moving the robot, placing and removing blocks, and creating and destroying blocks at a depot.

The actions defined in this domain include:

1. move: This action allows the robot to move from one position to another at the same height. The preconditions are that the robot is at the starting position, the starting position is a neighbor to the destination position, and both positions have the same height. The effect is that the robot is no longer at the starting position and is now at the destination position.

2. move-up: This action allows the robot to move from a lower position to a neighboring higher position. The preconditions are that the robot is at the starting position, the starting position is a neighbor to the destination position, the starting position has a certain height, and the destination position's height is one less than the starting position's height. The effect is that the robot is no longer at the starting position and is now at the destination position.

3. move-down: This action allows the robot to move from a higher position to a neighboring lower position. The preconditions are that the robot is at the starting position, the starting position is a neighbor to the destination position, the starting position has a certain height, and the destination position's height is one less than the starting position's height. The effect is that the robot is no longer at the starting position and is now at the destination position.

4. place-block: This action allows the robot to place a block at a neighboring position, increasing the height of that position by one. The preconditions are that the robot is at a position next to the block position, both positions have the same height, the robot has a block, and the block position is not a depot. The effect is that the height of the block position is increased by one, and the robot no longer has a block.

5. remove-block: This action allows the robot to remove a block from a neighboring position, decreasing the height of that position by one. The preconditions are that the robot is at a position next to the block position, the robot's position is one height unit higher than the block position, and the robot does not have a block. The effect is that the height of the block position is decreased by one, and the robot now has a block.

6. create-block: This action allows the robot to create a block at a depot. The preconditions are that the robot is at the depot and does not have a block. The effect is that the robot now has a block.

7. destroy-block: This action allows the robot to destroy a block at a depot. The preconditions are that the robot is at the depot and has a block. The effect is that the robot no longer has a block.
